Ottoman diacrtical keyboard
About:
This is a Mac keyboard layout package I designed in Ukelele specifically for transcribing Ottoman Turkish. 
It contains dedicated key combinations for a number of characters (s, d̤, ẕ, ḳ) not frequently found in Latin diacritical keyboard layouts for transcribing Arabic and Persian, and because it has been built on the basis of the Turkish QWERTY layout it retains many familiar key combinations for ş, ç, ı, ö, and ü, as well as the option to type â, î, ô, û, and ğ without changing keyboard.


Installation:
This process only works for Macs, Windows keyboard layouts use a different file format.

Option 1

This option has the advantage that you can use Ukelele to further modify the keyboard to your liking.

Download and install <a href="https://software.sil.org/ukelele/">Ukelele</a> (free) by following their prompts. You can then download the keyboard bundle <a href="https://github.com/theoknights/ottomandiacs/archive/main.zip"><b>here</b></a>. After unzipping the file, you will be presented with the folder ottomandiacs-main, opening the folder will reveal the file Ottoman Diacs.bundle. Double clicking the bundle will open a dialog box from Ukelele's keyboard installer utility prompting you to "install for current user," doing so will install the keyboard. To be able to use the keyboard you will need to either log out and log back in using the Apple menu or restart your computer.

After logging back in you will need to enable the keyboard. You can do so by navigating to System Settings > Keyboard and clicking Edit under Text Input. In the dialog box that appears click the + in the lower left-hand corner. In the new dialog box find Turkish and then select the Ottoman Diacs keyboard, then click Add. You will now be able to select Ottoman Diacs as a keyboard from the possible input sources in the upper right menu bar.

Option 2

Should you prefer to install the keylayout manually download the keyboard bundle <a href="https://github.com/theoknights/ottomandiacs/archive/main.zip"><b>here</b></a>. and unzip the file to reveal the Ottoman Diacs.bundle. Open a separate Finder window and navigate to Macintosh HD > Library > Keyboard Layouts and drag the bundle to this folder. To be able to use the keyboard you will need to either log out and log back in using the Apple menu or restart your computer.

After logging back in you will need to enable the keyboard. You can do so by navigating to System Settings > Keyboard and clicking Edit under Text Input. In the dialog box that appears click the + in the lower left-hand corner. In the new dialog box find Turkish and then select the Ottoman Diacs keyboard, then click Add. You will now be able to select Ottoman Diacs as a keyboard from the possible input sources in the upper right menu bar.
Keyboard Shortcuts
The keyboard has the following shortcuts for special characters, the mapping was intended to keep alternatives as close to the original keys as possible:
option + a = ā
option + c = ç
option + d = ḍ
option + r = d̤
option + e = ė
option + g = ġ
option + h = ḥ
option + f = ḫ
option + i = ı
option + p = ī
option + k = ḳ
option + n = ŋ
option + o = ö
option + [ = ō
option + s = ş
option + w = ṣ
option + q = s

option + u = ü
option + y = ū
option + z = ż
option + x = ẓ

option + l = ʿ
option + ` = ~ combined with previous letter
All letters other than ʿ and ʾ also support capitalization by depressing the shift key during the above shortcuts (eg. shift + option + i = I and shift + i = İ).

In addition, the circumflex accent, or şapka, on vowels and the g with breve, or yumuşak ğ, can be typed by long pressing the relevant letter and selecting the correct option from the pop up menu. Full documentation of the various keyboard shortcuts can be found here.
